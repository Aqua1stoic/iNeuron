    "(1) Boolean DataType are used to represent Boolean values in Python. They can be displayed as \"bool\" can be one of two values, either True or False. We use Booleans in programming to make comparisons and to control the flow of the program.\n",
    "True and False are keywords , so case sensitivity must be remembered while assigning them otherwise Python will give error\n",
    "All test conditions in Python return the result as bool which could be either True or False\n",

    "(2) Float DataType or floating-point are real values that Python also supports which are specified with a decimal pointJust like double data type of other languages like Java/C , float in Python has a precision of 16 digits\n",
    "For example >>So 2.5 , 3.14 , 6.9 etc are all examples of float data type\n",
    "Exponential notation is a scientific notation which is represented using e or E followed by an integer and it means to the power of 10 and float value can also be a representation of Exponential values. \n",

    "    The letter j is called unit imaginary number.It denotes the value of √-1 {root of minus 1}, i.e j² denotes -1\n",

    "Any other letter if used will generate error. The letter j , should only appear in suffix , not in prefix\n",
